# project-photograph-object-detection-cifar10-
The data used in the project was developed by <strong>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(CIFAR)</strong>
<p>The photos are in color with red,green and blue channels, but are small measuring 32 â‡¥ 32 pixel squares</p>
These pictures(Data) need not to undergo Preprocessing(except normalizing the pixel values).we can see some distortion in the images that have been forced to the square aspect ratio.

I've applied Adam and Stochastic Gradient descent optimizers for CNN model.

Thank you.
